# Mastering Arrays & Hashing: A Comprehensive Guide with Python Solutions

Arrays and hashing are fundamental concepts in data structures and algorithms. Mastering these topics can significantly improve problem-solving skills, especially in coding interviews.

---

## Introduction to Arrays & Hashing

- **Arrays**: Arrays are ordered collections of elements, all of the same type, stored at contiguous memory locations. Accessing elements by their index is very fast, making arrays useful for quick lookups, but they have fixed sizes in many programming languages.
  
- **Hashing**: Hashing is a technique used to map data to a fixed-size value (called a hash code). Hashing enables fast retrieval of data from hash tables or sets by converting a key into a unique hash value, which helps in quickly locating an item without scanning all items.

## Understanding Arrays & Hashing

### Arrays

- **Definition**: An array is a collection of elements, all of the same data type, stored in contiguous memory locations.
  
- **Operations**:
  - **Access**: Accessing an element using its index is \(O(1)\).
  - **Insertion/Deletion**: Inserting or deleting elements can be inefficient because all subsequent elements may need to be shifted.
  - **Traversal**: Iterating through an array takes \(O(n)\).

**Key Operations**:
1. **Accessing elements** by index: `arr[i]`
2. **Traversing** an array: `for num in arr: print(num)`
3. **Inserting/Deleting** elements: Operations may require shifting other elements.

### Hashing

- **Definition**: Hashing is the process of converting input into a fixed-size value. This is done using a hash function. Hash maps and sets use hashing to enable fast insertion, deletion, and search operations.

- **Operations**:
  - **Insertion**: Insert a key-value pair into the hash table.
  - **Search**: Retrieve a value using its key in constant time.
  - **Deletion**: Remove an element by key in constant time.

**Key Operations**:
1. **Insert**: `hash_map[key] = value`
2. **Search**: `value = hash_map[key]`
3. **Delete**: `del hash_map[key]`

## Key Concepts in Arrays & Hashing

1. **Indexing**: 
   - Arrays provide direct access to elements using an index.
   - Hashing maps keys to values, but the key doesnâ€™t always correspond directly to an index.

2. **Hash Functions**: 
   - A hash function takes an input and converts it to a hash code, which is used to determine the location of the element in a hash table.
   
3. **Hash Collisions**: 
   - Collisions occur when two different keys produce the same hash code. Common collision resolution strategies include **chaining** (storing multiple items at the same index) and **open addressing** (finding the next available spot).

4. **Two-Pointer Technique**: 
   - This technique is used to solve problems involving arrays and lists where you need to find pairs or subarrays with specific properties.

---

## Common Patterns in Arrays & Hashing

1. **Counting Elements**: Use a hash map to count occurrences of each element in an array.
2. **Finding Pairs/Triplets**: Hash maps and the two-pointer technique are helpful for finding pairs or triplets that meet certain conditions.
3. **Subarray Sum/Length Problems**: Prefix sum and hash maps can be used to solve problems involving subarrays with a particular sum or length.
4. **Groupings**: Grouping anagrams or items based on certain properties can be done efficiently with hash maps.

## Problem-Solving Using Arrays & Hashing: NeetCode Solutions

### 217. Contains Duplicate

**Problem Statement**:  
Given an integer array `nums`, return `true` if any value appears **more than once** in the array, otherwise return `false`.

### Example:
```plaintext
nums = [1, 2, 3, 3]
```

Output:  
```plaintext
true
```

### Solutions:

#### 1. **Brute Force Solution**

The brute force approach involves checking each pair of elements to see if any two elements are the same. This is a simple but inefficient solution.

```python
class Solution:
    def containsDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            for j in range(i + 1, len(nums)):
                if nums[i] == nums[j]:
                    return True
        return False
```

**Time Complexity**: \(O(n^2)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in `nums`.  
**Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\), as no extra space is used.

#### 2. **Sorting Solution**

We can sort the array first. If there are any duplicates, they will be adjacent in the sorted array, and we can check consecutive elements for equality.

```python
class Solution:
    def containsDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        nums.sort()
        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            if nums[i] == nums[i - 1]:
                return True
        return False
```

**Time Complexity**: \(O(n \log n)\), due to the sorting step.  
**Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\) or \(O(n)\), depending on the sorting algorithm used.

#### 3. **Hash Set Solution**

This approach uses a hash set to track the elements we've seen while iterating through the list. If an element is already in the set, we know it's a duplicate.

```python
class Solution:
    def containsDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        seen = set()
        for num in nums:
            if num in seen:
                return True
            seen.add(num)
        return False
```

**Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in the array. Each lookup and insertion in a set is \(O(1)\).  
**Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\), as we store up to \(n\) elements in the set.

#### 4. **Hash Set Length Solution**

Another way to check for duplicates is by comparing the length of the set (which removes duplicates) to the original list length. If they are not equal, there are duplicates.

```python
class Solution:
    def containsDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        return len(set(nums)) < len(nums)
```

**Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in the array.  
**Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\), because we are storing all unique elements in the set.
